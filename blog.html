  <article> Tips For Rising Juniors </h1>
  <h3> This message goes to those who are going into 11th grade next year. Most importantly, you should begin your post-secondary search early, whether its looking for post-secondary institutions or scholarships. If you plan on going to college, begin signing up and creating accounts on scholarship sites. Such as, QuestBridge, College Board, and Niche. You should also, sign yourself up on testing sites such as, Khan Acadamey. The best time to begin these things are in the fall, possibly beginning in October. This is so that you can take your time and practice all of the necessary material for college while also having more time to research scholarhsips. LOL, don't be like me and wait until late February to really begin studying for the SAT and looking for scholarships. If you do, you will have a lot more work to do over your summer. Another tip for researching scholarships is to, sign up for more state scholarships instead of national scholarships. Also, to look for essay scholarships instead of no essay scholarships. These are two pieces of advice that I have heard from experts and other adults. The reasoning behind these tips are that you are more likely to win a state scholarship then a national one, which everyone signs up for. Similarly, you are most likely to be awarded an essay scholarship than a no essay scholarship.

<h1 class="title"> How I Pushed Through This School Year</h1>
<h4 class="date"> 06/22/2021 </h4>
<p class="blog-content"> This year, 2020 to 2021 as everyone knows, has been and still is crazy. Honestly, this year is so chaotic that one word isn't enough to describe it. Many people are dying, crime rate is constantly increasing, there's an increase in protests, racism is a lot more present, and Covid is continuously raging.
   Throughout, this past school year I had faced many challenges such as, being bombarded with large amounts of schoolwork, losing family members and peers, and watching the world become more and more divided. Despite, these trials I worked hard to complete my assignments to the best of my ability and maintain high grades. 
    I managed to do these things through practicing a lot of self care and spending a lot of time learning and practicing the concepts that I was given.
