       One project that I coded in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program was a brief webpage on the tv show Spongebob Squarepants. I created this webpage in my first week of the program, during one of our daily asynchronous zoom sessions. The reason why I created this page was because I had completed the first required project of the program,the webpage that you are on now, early. So, I was given the option to code another site based on my favorite tv show or movie. But, this project isn't big in terms of content. Despite this, I learned many new coding skills through the creation of the page. For example, I was able to embed a link, align the layout of the text, and change the text color, which I wasn't able to do before. </h3>

       Another project that I coded is a Marvel's Avengers perosnality quiz. This quiz was one of the program's required coding projects.  I completed it on my second week of the program. A lot of hardwork and perseverance was needed to complete this personality quiz but I am glad that it is finished, I also learned a lot about javascript through completing it. </h3>

           So far in the Girls Who Code SIP program I have learned how to code multiple HTML websites with CSS details. I am also learned how to code quizzes and sites with interactive buttons. Overall, I know how to add images, links, and videos into my projects. As well as, edit the format and theme of my webpages,add other pages,create buttons, and much more.
