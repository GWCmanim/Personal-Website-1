<h3 class= "firstParagraph" class="intro"> Hello, my name is Imani Mitchell. I am 18 years old and I am a rising senior at Mastery Charter Lenfest Campus. I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and I am interested in becoming a pediatric doctor. I participate in numerous extracurricular activities and volunteer opportunities. This year is my first time participating in a coding program. Although, I have had a few brief introductions to coding in the past. On my website you will find my portfolio on my coding experience. As well as, a description of my interests, hobbies, and projects that I am interested in coding. You will also find my perspective on code.

<h3>
  Currently, I am only interested in learning how to code. I am not aspiring to become a computer scientist, but I find coding fascinating. I also find coding to be an important life skill. I beleive that learning how to code will have a positive impact on my postsecondary life, whether in my career or personal life. To me, coding is a skill that everyone should explore and learn how to do.
